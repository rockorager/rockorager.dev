[tangled.sh](https://tangled.sh) is a *fantastic* new git forge. It has all of
it's social features built around the AT Protocol (think Bluesky), and has what
I find to be a really nice PR workflow. They manage to get a workflow that I
prefer even over an email based workflow. To illustrate, imagine you have a PR
or patch series and before it's merged there will be at least one round of
review + updates. With an email workflow, you'd resend the series with a `v2` in
the prefix (ie `[PATCH v2]`). If there were multiple commits, the recipients get
a fresh new copy of all commits with the changes - but *what* changed between
revisions? Typically you have to rely on the author to *tell* you if it's a
large patch series, or maybe you can spot it. Here's an example from a patch I
sent it. I summarized the change just below the commit message...but that
doesn't mean much.

```
From: Tim Culverhouse <tim@timculverhouse.com>
To: ~rjarry/aerc-devel@lists.sr.ht
Subject: [PATCH aerc v2] deps: update vaxis to v0.10.1

Vaxis v0.10.1 brings with it a few bug fixes, major sixel performance
improvements, and a new VT extension which enables Vaxis to receive
window resize updates in-band via escape sequences on supported
terminals (foot, ghostty, iTerm2, and kitty as of this patch).

- Improved performance all around for sixels (thanks, delthas)
- Fix key decoding for Home and End for the st terminal
- Implement mode 2048 for in-band resizes
- Add quirk for tmux 3.4 to turn on unicode width measurements

Github allows for a few different ways to handle updates to a PR. First, you can
force push. This is like sending a new version of a patch series - all the
commits are replaced, and it's up to the reviewer to spot the changes (or the
committer to note them). Alternatively, you could push a *new* commit and then
it's very clear what changed. If the new commit is fixing a bug, and the project
wants a clean commit history, you are in a bit of a bind. Using the "Rebase and
Merge" button on Github *doesn't* autosquash...so even if the committer was nice
and did this update as a `--fixup`, it won't squash. You'll have to pull the
commit down manually, autosquash, then push. Then that PR is left hanging
there...it's a mess.

Tangled solves this by having round based reviews, similar to the email
workflow. The key difference is that you get an *interdiff* button. What's an
interdiff? **The diff between rounds**. How amazing is that? You can review
*exactly* what changed between each round.

Anyways, I am pretty happy with what they've built. You should try it out. I
also built a small CLI for working with tangled.sh...it's *very* barebones but
it let's you create a pr *without needing a fork or a branch*. You can `git
clone https://tangled.sh/rockorager.dev/knit` and then `knit pr create HEAD~1`
and your patch will appear on my repo as a PR. It's like git-send-email but
better.
